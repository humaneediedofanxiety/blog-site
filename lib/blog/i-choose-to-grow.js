        I think it's high time i bring my shit together, i am really tired and
        exhausted of my self destructive behavior and i choose to not do this
        anymore. I choose to grow out of my masochistic phase and I will do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        First off, I will create a more basic blog only focused on writing and
        practicing how to create content and keep it private, barebone styles
        and only two pages and minimal to the maximum. The current appearance is
        not even that bad, it's just too much for now I think so.
      </p>

      <p>And I'll regularly write new posts after that.</p>

      <p>
        And for the other things I'll take my time to plan everything out, from
        my career goals to my hobbies, strength training is also a priority,
        I'll take a more functional training approach rather than simply focus
        on powerlifting practices. I'll also start studying complex mathematics
        and computer engineering and follow my passion on engineering and
        innovation.
      </p>

      <p>
        And to keep myself sane, I'll spend more meaningful time alone and build
        a healthy relationship with myself and as far as I am concerned about my
        social life I'll ditch on dating as of now and find some good friends,
        love is overrated anyways.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyways I think that is all for now, I'll update after I have done a few
        things and made a pretty solid plan.
