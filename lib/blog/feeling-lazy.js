        Honestly, I am feeling really lazy today and don't wanna do anything and I'm not even sure entirely why — but maybe I can take a guess. It was probably last night — I slept early and took the pills, but still, I woke up in the middle of the night and goofed around till 7.

        I probably wouldn't have even written this post if I hadn't made the promise earlier to write a post daily for a while. But I still have to do the bare minimum of things: study for 50 minutes and go to the gym. I think that's all I will do — and maybe write down all the tasks for tomorrow and figure out a way to recover and solve my laziness.

      <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        I feel like this every once in a while and I think it's just part of life, so I don't even mind it much anymore — I just go on with it. Accept that I am lazy, do the bare minimum (complete all the promises I made to myself), and prepare for a harsh day tomorrow.
        I think sometimes you need to step back a little bit and relax.
