      <h3>Aiming for a medal in the championships.</h3>
      <p>
        I have set a ridiculous goal for myself. It’s only been about 4 months
        since I properly started training. Although I have trained in the past
        (mostly at home), I had a base that helped me push through fairly easily
        in the beginning. I have decided to win a medal at the national
        powerlifting competition coming up in the last few months of the year.
        It will be incredibly difficult, but I’m here for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I need a total of 320-350 kg (at 74kg bodyweight) to at least qualify
        for the national championships, and for any chance of getting a medal I
        must hit the 400kg mark. To aim for silver, I’d need around 430kg, and
        above 470kg for gold (note that these numbers may vary from time to
        time). This will be a tough haul, and I don’t even have a year left to
        achieve it.
      </p>
      <h3>How much do I lift as of now?</h3>
      <p>
        Revealing my current lifts: I have a decently strong lower body and an
        okay upper body. Currently, I can deadlift 150kg, squat 110kg, and bench
        press around 70kg, giving me a total of 330kg (I might qualify).
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to achieve my goal, I need a solid plan and a significant
        amount of effort. The current split I’m doing is a random mix of
        accessory and main lifts. If possible, I’ll get a solid plan suited for
        me from a good coach. I’m mainly looking to get my numbers up by
        focusing on my squat and deadlift since my lower body is already
        decently strong and muscular. That said, I won’t neglect my bench
        press—I need to work on my technique, too.
      </p>
      <h3>Can I really do it?</h3>
      <p>
        In the coming months before the competition, I plan to increase my
        deadlift to around 190kg, my squat to 160kg, and my bench press to a
        solid 100kg. It will be hard, but I’ll do my best. And don’t you think I
        should start taking creatine after all?
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, my training philosophy has been about training really hard and
        pushing to the limits every workout, even though recovery might be a
        challenge at first. I believe that by consistently training at full
        intensity, my body will eventually adapt.
      </p>
      <h3>Why am I really doing this</h3>
      <p>
        Now for the real question: why am I doing this? I don’t have a solid
        reason, but I really want to achieve this goal this year. I love doing
        many things and being good at them—life becomes really dull otherwise.
        Even though some people might criticize me for not sticking to a single
        thing for a long time, I simply want to experience and have fun with
        different pursuits. If there’s one thing I truly wish to do, it’s to
        “build.”
      </p>
      <p>I’ll update on my lifting journey every once in a while.</p>
