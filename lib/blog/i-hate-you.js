      <p>
        I need to buy a notebook so I can rant to myself but im too lazy and i
        forget to buy it when i go upwards so fuck it, fuck you and fuck
        everyone. I have tried to end my masochistic streak and find some good
        friends to talk to, I liked talking to someone and when I finally
        thought ill talk to em it seems like i chased them away, i cant do it -
        talking to people is too tough and frustrating Ill rather be my myself.
        i liked a lot of people in the past but ihave barely liked anyone for
        real, everything is just a casual attraction. I even tried to fall in
        love but nopes that is not gonna happen. I am not suited to romance.
        Whatever. I got too lazy to write so I didnt write for so long but today
        I decided to write again but i am putting barely any effort into what I
        write and I am simply ranting, well atleast everything is genuine or
        maybe not cause I don't know. You guys want some updates on my life? I
        figured out that I was too happy a few days ago and felt really guilty
        about it cause i don't really know and it's not like I did something bad
        to anyone and was happy about it, it was simply that my life was going
        great and I was happy about it, i was maybe guilty because while i was
        happy i wasnt at all grateful but i dont really know the real reason
        either, I legitimately dont have any real problems in my life, there is
        no tragedy no nothing and yet I feel extremely distressed about it. Oh
        well I think i am enjoying the distress or rather i am enjoying writing
        about it, english is not my native language so idk if i wrote any good
        or not. But anyways my rant is not yet over. I'll now rant about
        everything that's wrong in my life. I think I should create a more basic
        dull and depressing looking blog, this looks too optimistic to be about
        me but well I am too lazy so let it be and speaking about problems. I
        said I would fix my sleep schedule but here we go again I couldnt do it
        and lets be real i dont need to fix it, it's not worth it and yes I am
        coping here. Secondly I am barely having any progress in powerlifting
        but well "stick to it" lets see if i can do somethign about it or not i
        might just go bacvk to my old basic program adn the most frustrating
        thing of all is I am reading nietchze (forget the spelling i cnt fi it)
        qnd he is extremely frustrating to read and fuck my brain is fried too
        so i cant even focus but ill figure something out no worries I always
        do. I think i need to be more isolated I have come to truly hate people
        and I am overthinking everything and i wont talk about the things i have
        accomplished recently or positive things because I am not feeling like
        it, I am here maximizing my misery and I am absolutely aware about what
        I am doing. I'll cry. Maybe I am really hurt too, no matter how much I
        say I hate people i cant deny the fact that I am human too and I feel
        like having someone to talk to too, to have some friends i can count on.
        I say I don't mind when people behave bad or ignore or forget about me
        but that's not to say that I don't get hurt, it's just simply that im
        not angry and i don't hold a grudge. I promise i am having a mental
        breakdown and im not at all like how I am here, I am actually not that
        pessimistic, well who cares.
