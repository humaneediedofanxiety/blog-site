        I don't know what to do anymore, and I have set yet another mad goal to
        pursue — found a new method of doing things and I call it the "hell
        week." The whole point is to basically choose an insane goal to pursue
        and complete over the week.

        I delude myself into thinking I can do anything I set my mind to, that
        everything is possible — yes, I indeed am very delusional. But soon
        after I set my mind and body into a particular pursuit, I find out I am
        incapable of doing it, and thus I fall into a deep ocean of despair. And
        no, that is not the bad part — on the contrary, that is the good part. I
        find immense pleasure in the despair. I will do what I want.

        What is this sudden change of mood, and has my writing style changed a
        bit? I feel like it has too, but I think that is only because I haven’t
        got any sleep yet today either — and a few other things too. But I cease
        to care, simply because I write for myself and I write to myself.

        May I get to the main part — I have set a goal to complete the whole
        physics syllabus in a week (it's the annual syllabus). This is a mad
        goal, and I am almost certain I won’t succeed. But I plan on seeing how
        far I can go with a dozen hours of studying and a well-curated study
        system I had made before.

          Very bad writing and I know it — and I will update on this after the
          week.
