      <h3>How come I can't sleep at night.</h3>
      <p>
        It's 8 in the morning and I am writing this blog post simply because I
        can't sleep and I have nothing else to do, oh yes I am listening to
        music while I write too. Oh so do you think I have a very bad schedule?
        Yes I think so too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know how did it get so worse, sometimes I don't even sleep until
        the next night, sometimes I sleep for 4 and other times 14 and it's been
        like this for a while, of course I have tried to fix it multiple times
        in the past.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I really need to change it?</h3>
      <p>
        There is actually another question that came to my mind, do I really
        need to fix my schedule or can I make use of it? Let's find out then. I
        have had a solid schedule in the past too where I used to wake up early
        morning and get right to work, honestly those times had been really
        productive and I actually hate to work at night, most nights all I want
        to do is lay down and spend hours on my phone, so yes it would be
        optimal for me to wake up early.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I plan on changing it.</h3>
      <p>
        Now that I have come to the conclusion that I really want to change my
        schedule, how come I actually do it and how long would it even take.
        Okay I did the thinking now let's write it into existence, first of all
        â€” take melatonin pills an hour before your intended sleep time and
        immediately block all distractions such as YouTube and social media
        preferably using a scheduled app blocker and now the hard part, become
        consistent going to bed early until the habit has been ingrained into
        your identity.
      </p>

      <h3>What next?</h3>
      <p>
        Now to keep me accountable, I will drop another post with updates after
        exactly three weeks on 26th April. I will include all the techniques I
        tried and did I succeed at my attempt to fix my schedule and if not then
        why.
