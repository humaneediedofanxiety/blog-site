      <h3>I can't actually write but I must.</h3>
      <p>
        Truth be told, I can't write and learning to write will take quite a bit
        of time and quite a bit more effort and honestly I can't afford that as
        I have other important things to handle but I still need a way to
        express myself and thus I decided to write "junk" â€” write without the
        pressure and write absolutely anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        I plan on writing one post every single day whether it's a well curated
        post or a random thought I had on a random evening, whatever it is I
        make the promise to myself that I will write daily at least for a while.{" "}
        <em>Writing is honestly very freeing.</em>
      </p>
      <h3>What do I plan to write next?</h3>
      <p>
        Not entirely sure but I have some ideas, maybe I would write on the
        things I am working on right now such as preparing for a powerlifting
        competition and learning to read or maybe write posts on something I
        plan to do in the foreseeable future.
