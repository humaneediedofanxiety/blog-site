      <p>
        It is very difficult for me to properly make anyone understand my
        situation. It wouldn't be wrong to say even I don't understand why I am
        the way I am, but nonetheless, I have accepted it. I probably won’t be
        able to articulate my thoughts very well on this topic — so pardon me if
        it’s hard to follow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything overwhelms me. I can't handle multiple conversations at once.
        I can't keep any social media account once it gets a little crowded —
        whether it’s followers, texts, or just noise. I’ve deleted a dozen
        Instagram accounts, and right now, I don't even have one. Same goes for
        Discord — I’ve wiped my friend list and switched accounts countless
        times. I don’t know why I’m like this, but everything irritates me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I can’t even hold decent conversations with the few online friends I
        have. I can’t connect with them and eventually, everything feels forced.
        No one even talks to me unless I talk to them first. So I’ve just given
        up on trying to talk to people. I hate it. I've become comfortable being
        alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s not like I have many friends in real life either — just two people
        I can really connect with. I consider them my best friends, but they
        live far and are usually busy. We barely talk online. I know a few more
        people — others might say I’m friends with them — but I don’t really see
        it that way. They're just people I know. They don’t care how I am, and
        honestly, I don’t care how they are either.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s very true that the problem is within me, but I can’t help it. I
        feel like I’m unwanted most of the time. And besides, I can’t connect
        with anyone besides those two friends I mentioned. But I think it’s not
        a problem anymore. It’s just how life is now, and I’m learning to live
        with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s been a while, and I’ve almost figured out how to deal with the
        loneliness. Most of the time, I find comfort in the stories of fictional
        characters or people from the past — in books, movies, and even video
        games. I might be what you'd call “the stereotypical loser” — no social
        life, always in the room, watching stuff, deep in games.
      </p>

      <p>
        But at the end of the day, I do want someone to talk to freely. I just
        think… maybe I’m too cool, too smart, too handsome, and too good for
        people to like me or be friends with me. That’s the real reason I don’t
        have a social life: because I’m too good for everyone.
