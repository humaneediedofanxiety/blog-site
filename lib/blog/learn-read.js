      <h3>I need to learn to read</h3>
      <p>
        I have decided to learn to read and why is that so? simply because I am
        dumb and also because I want to. I want to try reading fiction and
        academic texts mainly to increase my reading efficiency and
        comprehension, why fiction tho? Because it's the best thing I can think
        of besides academics. I have read a ton of non-fiction and self help in
        the past but I don't find them likable anymore but yes I mainly got into
        reading as a teen because of those but now I want to level up a bit and
        I want to do it by reading the <i>*greats.*</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have decided to read, Kafka, Nietchze, Dostoevsky, Camus, Satre and
        more. I bought a few books a few weeks ago and here is a list of all the
        books I am going to read for the upcoming days (Notes from Underground,
        The Metamorphosis & Other Stories, Beyond Good & Evil, 1984 & The
        Alchemist) and I'll buy "The Princeton Guide To Mathematics".
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll be reading both a fiction book and an academic book simultaneously
        to make the process of reading more fun and efficient, I will first read
        through physics books and "The Metamorphosis & Other Stories" & "Notes
        from Underground". I'll decide what to read after I finish these.
      </p>
      <h3>How should I actually read?</h3>
      <p>
        The process of reading, for the fictions - read through the book
        thoroughly and without any distraction on the first read and after you
        are done, go through a professional analysis and breakdown of the book
        (find these on google) and try to understand it and finally after you
        are done, reread the book this time for a clearer understanding and mark
        certain words and sentences if you feel so. And for the academic texts,
        my best advice would be to read and research as you go and after every
        section/topic/chapter - make yourself understand using the Feynmann
        Technique for a more clear understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        How much time can I really allocate to this, for the time being -
        reading is my first priority and then comes powerlifting but that is
        only for the current month or the next, after that I have to prepare for
        exams so I can afford a month or so for reading and maybe 4 hours daily.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="font-bold">Final thoughts</span>, I like reading and I
        will learn how to.
